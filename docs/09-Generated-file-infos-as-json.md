# Generated file infos as json

If you want to see what files your t4 generates, there should be a .json-File next to your .tt-File (.info.json). It contains a list of all file infos of your generated files. The .json-File is also used to clean up the files if there should be path changes after regenerating files in this step `fileManager.Generate()`  or `fileManager.Process()`.
