# Living documentation and testing

Since the old version of the FileManager had bugs in new versions of Visual Studio, we decided to develop the new one with BDD and end 2 end tests in Visual Studio. Our goal is the detection of breaking changes in further versions of Visual Studio and a list of supported features with examples.

The last end 2 end test can be found [here](../T4FileManagerVisualStudio.html).
